## Audio Visualizer

For my second I assignment, I opted to play with sound. I generated an audio visualizer. It starts with a single beat. Every few seconds, a new beat is added, and the backgroud color the audio visuals change accordingly. As the beat gets more intense, I made the visuals more exteme. 

Then, when the beat goes to its extremest, the visual shifts to two people dancing. The mosaic circles dance from one color to the next while the two dancers dance together agaisnt the beat.
