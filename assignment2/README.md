# Audio Visualizer

For my second I assignment, I opted to play with sound. I generated an [audio visualizer](https://youtu.be/9OtP2RiHGFg). It starts with a single beat. Every few seconds, a new beat is added, and the backgroud color the audio visuals change accordingly. As the beat gets more intense, I made the visuals more exteme.

Then, when the beat goes to its extremest, the visual shifts to two people dancing. The mosaic circles dance from one color to the next while the two dancers dance together agaisnt the beat.

## Inspiration
I found the audio visualizers presented in class very fascinating and engaging on a higher level than visuals presented without sound. We are using two senses rather than one, which makes us more aware and attentive. It made me really want to play around with sound and experiment with it. 

## Process
Since we have not covered working with sound much in class, I was intimdated about going down that path. However, with a few youtube tutorials, a good amount of errors, lots of debugging and experimenting, I managed to get what I wanted. I downloaded sounds which would sound upbeat when played together. I played around with generatinf different shapes in different patterns and colors which kept adusting and adjusting until I was satisfied with how they looked, how well the matched the increasing beat, and how smooth/harsh the trasition is from one pattern to the next. 

I struggled quite a bit with the mosaic of the two people dancing. Windows does not support video playback with ofVideoPlayer, I had to install codec and even with that not all videos worked. Playing around with the code and trying out different videos definately took a while to reach what I wanted, but I finally did it and the struggle was worth my satisfaction with the final product.
