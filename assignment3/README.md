# Virtual Interactive Museum

For my final assignment, I decided to create a [virtual museum](https://youtu.be/nmv4-_SnzEo). The program starts with a glitch and a loading screen, giving it an achrival effect. It then shifts to the main menu scene, which consists of clouds and three doors. Whenever the mouse is hovered over a door, a knocking sound plays.

If we click on the right-most door, the screen turnes black and ET by Katy Perry starts playing. The vocals are faint, and only if the user is drawing something does the volume rise. When the user drags the mouse, three polylines get drawn and dance between colors. The topmost polyline reacts to the song frequency and that generates a cool effect. If the user presses the spacebar, the screem gets cleared, and if the user pressed the 'B' key, they are returned back to the home screen.

The middle door has a beat playing in the background at half the volume and a background changing color. There are 8 squares, and each gets darker and plays a sound effect when the mouse is hovered over it.

The left-most door plays the French song Derniere Dance by Indila. A mosiac of a video of girl ballet dancing with the Eiffel tower behind her plays on the screen.
