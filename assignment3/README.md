# Virtual Interactive Museum

For my final assignment, I decided to create a [virtual museum](https://youtu.be/nmv4-_SnzEo). It puts the user in a futuristic mood with the bright colors and interactivity features. The user travels through the museum and interacts with the artwork or simply sit there to admire. The program starts with a glitch and a loading screen, giving it an achrival effect. It then shifts to the main menu scene, which consists of clouds and three doors. Whenever the mouse is hovered over a door, a knocking sound plays.

If we click on the right-most door, the screen turnes black and ET by Katy Perry starts playing. The vocals are faint, and only if the user is drawing something does the volume rise. When the user drags the mouse, three polylines get drawn and dance between colors. The topmost polyline reacts to the song frequency and that generates a cool effect. If the user presses the spacebar, the screem gets cleared, and if the user pressed the 'B' key, they are returned back to the home screen.

The middle door has a beat playing in the background at half the volume and a background changing color. There are 8 squares, and each gets darker and plays a sound effect when the mouse is hovered over it.

The left-most door plays the French song Derniere Dance by Indila. A mosiac of a video of girl ballet dancing with the Eiffel tower behind her plays on the screen.

## Reflection
It was very exciting working on this assignment. It was also very time consuming. I am not very satisfied with the middle door. If I had more time, I would have generated an interactive audio visualizer instead, where the user can draw random shapes which interact with the audio and at the same time add a sound to the beat. I wouuld have also made my project more complete by, for example, highlighting the door which the mouse is hovered over generating a smoother transition when entering through each door, to list a few. It was my first time using images for illustration, and using the mouse clicked, dragging, and key pressed feature. I will definitely be building on this project in the future on my own time.
