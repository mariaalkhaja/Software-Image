# Homework 3

I created a hynotizing swril. 

When the program runs, "you will be hypnotized" gets printed on the screen. Each word is prints 2 seconds after the word before it, and is printed 36 times around a circle but only one of the repitions is highlighted in red. the transparency slowly fades off from each word to the next.
