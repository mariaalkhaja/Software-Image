# Homework 3

I created a hynotizing swril. 

When the program runs, "you will be hypnotized" gets printed on the screen. I downloaded a fond for the text. Each word is printed 2 seconds after the word before it, and is printed 36 times around a circle but only one of the repitions is highlighted in red. The words keep roataing around the circle. The transparency slowly fades off from each word to the next.

That goes on for a few seconds, then the hypnosis begins. For that, 33 circles are drawn on the screen, and they move around smoothly in a hypnotizing pattern.

The program starts over every 45 seconds.
