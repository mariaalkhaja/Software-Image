# Falling Screen

My project can be seen as two screens on top of each other. The top screen puzzles the image and the bottom screen bonds image. The user can use the noise slider to control how puzzled the image is and can move the image pieces between the two screens using the puzzle slider. The color of the background can also be adjusted with the background sliders, where the user can adjust the red, green, and blue values. 

This project was inspired by the work of JUNKIYOSHI (https://junkiyoshi.com/openframeworks20210402/) titled two screens, one source, where a continuous loop of a video of the ocean rises and falls between the two screens. I adjusted his code to change it into a still image, using sliders for the rise and fall of the images. I also added in controlling the noise and multiple images for the user to choose from. 

I am satisfied with the work. It is aesthetically pleasing to work with. The most challenging part was working with open frameworks. Everything would suddenly stopped working on me multiple times and the resolving process was different each time.
